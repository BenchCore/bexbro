## Background
`bexbro` is the official MultiChain Command CLI for BenchCore `RootChains` and `SideChain` and was built from Ark's original blockchain [ark-node](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/ark-node) and derives directly from , which derived from [Lisk](https://lisk.io) and was originally known as **Crypti**. It has come a long way since then and is one of the most battle tested blockchain libraries on the face of the planet.
You can connect to the BenchChain Live Network and Test Network as well as many of our native `SideChains` like `MUZ`, `SHARE`, `VID`, `SHOP` and `DAN`.

## Why The Internet Must Have A Decentralized Alternative
Today, the internet is more censored than ever and it's only getting worse. Our mission with the [dWeb Protocol](https://github.com/distributedweb/dweb) was to create a truly powerful P2P protocol, around [benOS](https://github.com/benchOS/benos), [dBrowser](https://github.com/benchOS/dbrowser) and many of benOS' underlying libraries to bring the most powerful P2P products to life. In the last few months, by rebuilding P2P technologies that have existed since the early 2000s, we have built a powerful suite of decentralized libraries for benOS and the Bench Network, that will only improve over time. But we also brought new ideas to life, like:

- [dDrive](https://github.com/distributedweb/ddrive)
- [dExplorer](https://github.com/distributedweb/dexplorer)
- [dDatabase](https://github.com/distributedweb/ddatabase)
- [dSites](https://github.com/distributedweb/dsites)
- [dPack](https://github.com/distributedweb/dpack)
- [benFS](https://github.com/benchOS/benfs)
- [DCDN](https://github.com/distributedweb/dcdn)
- [Rocketainer](https://github.com/distributedweb/rocketainer)
- [RocketOS](https://github.com/distributedweb/rocketos)
- [dNames](https://github.com/distributedweb/dnames)
- [P2PDNS](https://github.com/distributedweb/p2pdns)
- [dWebFS](https://github.com/distributedweb/dwebfs)
- [dWebDB](https://github.com/distributedweb/dwebdb)
- [MeteorIDE](https://github.com/distributedweb/meteorIDE)
- [Kepler](https://github.com/benchlab/kepler)
- [Neutron](https://github.com/benchlab/neutron)
- [Designate](https://github.com/benchlab/designate)
- [Nova](https://github.com/benchlab/nova)

and more! These were the protocols and libraries that we needed to create a completely decentralized operating system, where everything was distributed, protected and people were once again in control of their data. benOS is made up of over 1100+ different libraries that we are releasing on a day-by-day basis as we move them to a stable/production state. While financial support is great for this open source project, we need developers who want to be some of the first to build the `dApps` and `dSites` of the future. We have to take back what our forefathers originally designed for freedom, by making our code the law, instead of releasing weak and highly centralized applications where law cannot be applied because the code lacks the foundation to implement a legal framework for itself. Join us for a truly historic journey on the [BenchLabs Telegram](https://t.me/benchlabs). See you there.
